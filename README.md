You'll need to import the libsbgnpy library

createSBGN: The glyphs and arcs components that are already in the createSBGN are of the adh.sbgn file.

renderSBGN: When you runs this file, it'll ask to enter the name of the prexisting SBGN file(has to be in the same folder - which I'm trying to fix so that the exisitng SBGN file can be detected even if it's not in the same folder as renderSBGN). The rendered SBGN file will be saved as a PNG file in the same folder. 

readSBGN: Asks for the name of the prexisting SBGN file(same issue with renderSBGN), and reads out the coordinates of the SBGN components(glyphs and arcs)



I included the SBGN files I found online, which you can experiment with the renderSBGN.py file to see the PNG result.
